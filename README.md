# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository began as starter code which offered the server-side ready to go. 

"For the project, students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills."



## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above
- Body Parser
- Chance
- MD5

## Current featureset

- Tweets can be composed with live character count, and posted to the feed
- Usernames, avatars and @handles are generated by the server on each post
- The composer window can slide in/out of view by clicking 'Write a new tweet' or, after scrolling down the page, the 'return to top' arrow also slides the composer into view
- The site is responsive, resizing for mobile, tablet and desktop

## Current limitations

- The server database is in-memory, so all tweets will be lost upon server shutdown, sorry influencers
